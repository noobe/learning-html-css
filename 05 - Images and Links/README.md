# Images and Links

`<img>` tag used to embed images to HTML document.
The `<img>` tag is empty, it contains attributes only, and does not have a closing tag.
The `<img>` tag has two required attributes:
  `src` - Specifies the path to the image
  `alt` - Specifies an alternate text for the image
The `src` path could be complete or relative.
When a web page loads, it is the browser, at that moment, that gets the image from a web server and inserts it into the page. Therefore, make sure that the image actually stays in the same spot in relation to the web page, otherwise your visitors will get a broken link icon. The broken link icon and the alt text are shown if the browser cannot find the image.
