# HTML Layout Elements
- HTML has several semantic elements that define the different parts of a web page:
  1. `<header>` - Defines a header for a document or a section
  2. `<nav>` - Defines a set of navigation links
  3. `<section>` - Defines a section in a document
  4. `<article>` - Defines an independent, self-contained content
  5. `<aside>` - Defines content aside from the content (like a sidebar)
  6. `<footer>` - Defines a footer for a document or a section
  7. `<details>` - Defines additional details that the user can open and close on demand
  8. `<summary>` - Defines a heading for the `<details>` element
